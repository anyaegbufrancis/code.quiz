## BRIEF DISCRIPTION

In this project, browser based quiz testing system is presented. The testing system is time based, rewards a correct score with a score and punishes a wrong option with a 5 seconds deduction. This is a reusable testing machine where the question bank can easily be updated by changing the questions but in thesame array format. This is completely browser based, heavily employs Javascript and JQuery in its logic and CSS and HTML in presentation. For each test cycle, a random 10 question was presented, thus a randomizer is employed. The interface is simple to use and completely responsive.

## REQUIREMENT
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

## APPROACH

The approach adopted is as follows:

1. A pseudocode was developed in a rough sketch, itemizing the concepts, fuctions, the variables and how they will beconsumed.
2. The base HTML pages are coded.
3. Basic styling was applied to differentiate the codes.
4. Tags are applied to each object/element that needs to be targeted to achieve a particular feature.
5. Each base function was coded using Javascript and JQUERY maily.
6. Error checking and fail conditions are checked in the logic and bugs fixed.
7. Naming, Tagging and references are updated to reflect updated logic.
8. Final polishing was applied using CSS.
9. Code was refactored and restested.
10. Few more features were added and old features are optimized.
11. Final code was uploaded to github

## GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The finished work is made up of the following:

1. One main landing HTML page (index.html).
2. One Exam Logic HTML page (exampg.html)
3. One Report Dashboard HTML page. This is a dual page with dynamic page hiding and exposure feature depending on click condition (reportDashboard.html).
4. One mail JavaScript document containing ALL the Logic.

## RELEVANT POINTS

- Local Storage was employed as placeholder for values in this project.
- Certain page are reused for multiple functions by hiding some elements on the page.
- Functions are employed whereever possible to make the product a bit modular.

# Future Efforts

* The timer presently kicks in at the instruction page of the test and is not restricted to the question pages again. The pages reloads completion page at the expiration of the set time. A little more time will be devoted to fixing this.
